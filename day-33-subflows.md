# Flow Designer – Subflows in ServiceNow (Day 4)

Subflows are **reusable, modular logic blocks** within the ServiceNow Flow Designer. They are designed to simplify and optimize workflows by allowing the reuse of commonly performed actions across different flows.

## 📌 What Are Subflows?

A **subflow** is a predefined set of actions that can be triggered by other flows or subflows. Instead of rewriting logic repeatedly, you create a subflow once and use it wherever required.

## ✅ When to Use Subflows

- 🔁 **Avoid repetitive logic** – Save time by reusing predefined logic blocks  
- ⚙️ **Automate frequent steps** – Actions like approvals or task creation  
- 🧩 **Break down complex flows** – Modularize flows for better readability and testing  
- 🧵 **Cross-team usability** – Share subflows across HR, IT, Finance, and more

## 🌟 Benefits of Subflows

- ♻️ **Reusability**  
- 📉 **Simplified workflows**  
- 🛠️ **Centralized updates**  
- 🔍 **Easier maintenance**

## 🍽️ Real-World Use Case: Restaurant Staff Onboarding

Imagine you're automating the onboarding process for a new restaurant employee. You can create a subflow that:

- Assigns kitchen equipment  
- Sends out onboarding emails  
- Notifies the head chef  
- Creates a checklist task  

This subflow can then be reused for different teams (kitchen, service, cleaning), ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy.

## ⚡ Pro Tip

Use **input variables** to make subflows flexible. This allows them to adapt to different flow needs without modification.
