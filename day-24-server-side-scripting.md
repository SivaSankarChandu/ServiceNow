# 🚀 Why Server-Side Scripting Matters in ServiceNow (and Beyond)

Ever wondered what happens when you submit a form or trigger a workflow in ServiceNow?  
The real magic happens **on the server** — here's why server-side scripting is essential.

## 🔍 What is Server-Side Scripting?

Server-side scripting refers to JavaScript code that runs on the ServiceNow server instead of in the user's browser.  
This code is used to manage, process, and protect data behind the scenes.
