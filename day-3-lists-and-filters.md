# Day 3: Lists and Filters in ServiceNow

## 📋 What are Lists?

Lists are views that display records from a table in a tabular format. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a field.

### Example:  
Opening the **Incident** table shows a list of all incident records, including fields like `Number`, `Priority`, `Assigned To`, and `State`.

## 🔍 What are Filters?

Filters let you narrow down list results by defining conditions.

### Filter Examples:
- Priority = High  
- State = New  
- Assignment Group = Network Team

You can build filters using the **Condition Builder**, which supports:
- AND/OR logic
- Dynamic filters (like "Assigned to Me")
- Saved filters (Favorites)

---

## 🎯 Why They Matter

- Save time by quickly finding relevant records.
- Help build reports and dashboards.
- Essential for working in large tables like `incident`, `change_request`, etc.

## 🧠 Tips

- Right-click column headers to filter quickly.
- Use breadcrumbs to visualize active filters.
- Save filters you use often!
