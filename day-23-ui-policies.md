# UI Policy in ServiceNow

## 🔍 What is a UI Policy?
A UI Policy is a client-side rule used to dynamically control the behavior of fields on a form in ServiceNow. You can make fields mandatory, read-only, or visible based on certain conditions, all without writing any custom scripts.

## ⚙️ How It Works
UI Policies allow you to set rules that dictate the behavior of fields based on specific conditions. Common use cases include:

- **👁️ Set Field Visibility**: Control the visibility of fields based on user input.
- **📝 Make Fields Mandatory**: Ensure certain fields are filled out before form submission.
- **🔒 Enable or Disable Fields**: Prevent users from modifying fields in certain conditions.

## 💡 Example Use Case
When **Urgency = High**, make the **Impact** field mandatory and visible. This is a classic use case where the UI Policy ensures that users are prompted to fill out critical information when a certain condition is met.

## ✅ Why Use UI Policy?
- **🔧 Reduces Need for Scripting**: No custom code is needed for basic form behavior.
- **⚡ Enhances Form Interactivity**: Makes forms dynamic and responsive to user input.
- **✨ Improves User Experience**: Streamlines the process by focusing the user's attention on relevant fields.
